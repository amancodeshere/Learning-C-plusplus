# C++ Learnin

I am doing this with the aid of BroCode's Tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TkoO8Z07hI) and FreeCodeCamp's C++ Beginner to Advanced Program(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o&t=6455s). I really do recommend these tutorials as they are great to start learning C++.

All files in the repo are here for my learning with the majority of the current files being very similar to BroCode's tutorial code as of now.
